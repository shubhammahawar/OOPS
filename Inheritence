Inheritence  -

Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. 
It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).

The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. 
When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. 
Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.

 Inheritence is used for -:
For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).
For Code Reusability.

class Person{

int age;

void eligibleForVote(){
System.out.println("Eligible for Vote");
}

void ElectionDay(){
System.out.println("Its a Election Day");
}

}

class Boy extends Person{

void eligibleForVote(){
System.out.println("Boy eligible for vote");
}

public static void main(String args[]){
Boy obj = new Boy();

obj.eligibleForVote(); // method override
obj.electionDay();

}
}
