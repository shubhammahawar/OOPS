Encapsulation : 

It is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together the code and the data it manipulates.
Technically, in encapsulation, the variables or the data in a class is hidden from any other class and 
can be accessed only through any member function of the class in which they are declared.

Encapsulation can be achieved by declaring all the variables in a class as private and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of the variables.

class Student{

private int rollId;

public void setRollId(int id){
this.rollId = id;
}

public int getRollId(){
return rollId;
}

}

class Test {

public static void main(String[]args){
Student obj = new Student();
obj.setRollId(5);
System.out.println(obj.getRollId());
}

}
