Polymorphism : It is the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.
Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

1. Compile Time Polymorphism : Method Overloading 

When there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be overloaded. 
Functions can be overloaded by changes in the number of arguments or/and a change in the type of arguments.

class Add {

static int addition(int a, int b){
return a+b;
}

static int addition (double a, double b, double c){
return a+b+c;
}
}

class Test {

public static void main (string args[]){
System.out.println(Add.addition(5,7));
System.out.println(Add.addition(7.8, 9.2, 4.8));
}
}



2. Run Time Polymorphism :Method Overriding
 Method overriding occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class. 
 That base function is said to be overridden.
